\item A 3-input majority gate is defined by the logic function \(M(a, b, c) = ab + bc + ca\). Which one of the following gates is represented by the function \(M\overline{(M(a, b, c)}, M(a, b, \overline{c}), c)\)?
\begin{enumerate}

    \item 3-input NAND gate 
    \item 3-input XOR gate 
    \item 3-input NOR gate 
    \item 3-input XNOR gate 
    
\end{enumerate}
