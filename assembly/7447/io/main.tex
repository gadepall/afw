We show how to program the 7447 BCD-Seven segment
display decoder through AVR-Assembly.
%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.,ref=\theenumi]
\item Connect the 7447 IC to the seven segment display.
\item Make connections between the 7447 and the arduino according to 
\tabref{table:7447_ard}.
\item Execute the following program.  The number 5 will be displayed.
\begin{lstlisting}
assembly/7447/io/codes/op_7447.asm
\end{lstlisting}
\item Now generate the numbers 0-9 by modifying the above program.
%
\item Execute the following program after making the connections in Table \ref{table:assembly/7447/io/ip_7447_ard}.  The number 3 will be displayed. What does the program do?
\begin{lstlisting}
assembly/7447/io/codes/ip_7447.asm
\end{lstlisting}

\end{table}
\solution The program reads from pins 10-13 and displays the equivalent decimal value on the display by writing to pins 2-5 of the arduino.
\item Explain the following instructions
\begin{lstlisting}
	ldi r17, 0b11000011 ; identifying input pins 10,11,12,13
	ldi r17, 0b11111111 ;
	out PORTB,r17		; 
	in r17,PINB
\end{lstlisting}
\solution First define pins 10,11,12 and 13 as input pins. Then ensure that these pins have the input 1 by default. Load the inputs from the pins in port B (which includes pins 10-13) into R17.
\end{enumerate}
