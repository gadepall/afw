We show how to control an led using AVR-GCC. AVR-GCC
is a C compiler for the Atmega328p.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.,ref=\theenumi]
\item Execute the following
\begin{lstlisting}
cd avr-gcc/setup/codes

make
\end{lstlisting}

\item Now open \textbf{main.c}. Explain the following lines.
\begin{lstlisting}
    PORTB = ((0 <<  PB5));
	_delay_ms(500);
//turn led on
    PORTB = ((1 <<  PB5));
    _delay_ms(500);
\end{lstlisting}
\solution $((0 <<  PB5))$ writes 0 to pin 13 (PB5).  \_delay\_ms(500) introduces a delay of 500 ms.  
\item Modify the above code to keep the led on.
\item Repeat the above exercise to keep the led off.

\end{enumerate}
